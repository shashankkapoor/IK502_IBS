There are 10 EEG recording files.
All the recordings have 19 channels.
The files are in .npy format and can be easily loaded with numpy.load() function.
All .npy files have 19 rows and x number of columns, 19 represents the number of channels and x represents the number of sample points. x may vary across different recordings, and it is dependent on the duration of a particular recording.
Sampling frequency is 100 Hz.


Code to read data the data and convert it to numpy array format
import numpy as np
X = np.load(filename) # read the file and convert it to numpy array
